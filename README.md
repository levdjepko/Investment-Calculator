# Investment-Calculator
This is a simple app to calculate the possible amount of investments over time.
It has an ability to change the expected rate of return, contributions, and time.
A big difference between many similar calculators is that there's an automatic conversion using the 4% rule (for financial independence).
This means that it tells you how much would be your expected passive income monthly.

There's a new version for Android in the works
