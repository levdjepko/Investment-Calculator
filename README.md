# Investment-Calculator
This is a simple app to calculate possible amount of investments over time.
It has an ability to change expected rate of return, contributions and time.
Big difference between many similar calculators is that there's an automatic conversion using 4% rule (for financial independence).
Which means that it tells you how much would be your expected passive income monthly
There's a new version for Android in works
